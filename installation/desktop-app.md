# Desktop App

The desktop application is the easiest way to get up and running.

## Downloading

Find the [latest version here](https://downloads.openwork.shop/Makerverse/index.html).

_Look for the name of your operating system (**win**, **mac**, or **linux**) in the filename. If there are multiple options, you probably want the one with "64" in the name, though it will depend on your computer's processor._
