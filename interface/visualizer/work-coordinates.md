# Work Coordinates

Work Coordinates allow you to define a relative coordinate system, such that operations begin from a different origin.

## Work Coordinate Offsets (WCO)

The offset marks the origin of any GCode programs (where they will start execution).
Moving it (dragging) allows you to align the plan to your work area, so that it fits in the desired spot.
