## Philosophy

The development of MakerHub is guided by certain principles:

- **Portability**: we attempt to support all hardware -- both in the "maker machines" that MakerHub can connect to, and in the wide variety of computers (Mac, Ubuntu, Win, Raspbian, etc.) that are supported.
- **Isolated Efficiency**: a MakerHub deployment is meant to be low-profile and self-contained. By using as little overhead as possible, it can run on a wider array of hardware (see: portability).
