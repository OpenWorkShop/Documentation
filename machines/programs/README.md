# Programs

A program is a set of instructions which tells the machine what to do.

By far, the most common format for programs is [GCode](gcode.md).
This is the only program format supported by MakerHub at the moment.

## Creating Programs

Generally, you create a program by exporting your design from some CAD software.

**Programs are uniquely tailored to your machine**.
The program would be different if you had a different tool (e.g., router bit) loaded, a different thickness of material, or for one of many other reasons.
Thus, while it is possible to share programs if you know that the creator had an identical configuration, most users start with a CAD design and export the program for their machine.
