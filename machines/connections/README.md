# Machine Connections

Each machine must be configured once on the [hub](../../interface/hubs) so that MakerHub knows how to "talk" to it.

- [New Machines](new.md) _can be connected to via the home screen._
- [Machine Profiles](profiles.md) _contain standard configurations for common machines._
- [Ports](ports.md) _are the physical link to the machine, e.g., USB_.
