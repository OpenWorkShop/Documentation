# Firmware Settings

The machine stores important settings (like those for [calibration](../calibration)) on the machine itself using onboard memory.

## Onboard Memory

The machine stores these settings itself.
In other words, these settings are **not** stored by MakerHub.
For example, you could connect the machine to a different [hub](../../interface/hubs) (or even a different app entirely) and the machine's calibration would still remain accurate.
