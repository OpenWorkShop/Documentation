# Firmware

Firmware is the code which is flashed onto the machine itself. Your machine likely came pre-installed with some firmware.

If you have selected a [machine profile](../profiles.md), you will receive recommendations and support links for your firmware.

The firmware is able to store various [settings](settings.md) that help to [calibrate](../calibration) and run the machine.

## Known Firmware

- [Grbl](grbl.md) _the most common CNC firmware_
- [Maslow](maslow.md) _for hanging-pendant CNC designs_
- Marlin

_Support for other machine types will be added over time..._
