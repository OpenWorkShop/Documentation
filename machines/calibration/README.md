# Calibration

Some machines may need to be calibrated, which accounts for real-world variability (for example, if the machine is not perfectly level).

- [Manufacturer Defaults](defaults.md) can help set up a new machine with the settings recommended by the manufacturer.
- [Modals](modals.md) are settings which are stored with the [firmware](../firmware).
