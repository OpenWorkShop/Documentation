# Machine Types

Different types of machines have different capabilities.

- [CNC](cnc.md) machines are "subtractive;" they cut materials (_wood, aluminum, paper, etc._).
- **3D Printer** machines are "additive;" they extrude liquid materials to create something from scratch.

_Right now, MakerHub only supports CNC machines._
